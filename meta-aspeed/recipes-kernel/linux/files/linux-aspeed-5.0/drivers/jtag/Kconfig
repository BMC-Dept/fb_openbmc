menuconfig JTAG
    tristate "JTAG support"
    ---help---
      This provides basic core functionality support for jtag class devices
      Hardware equipped with JTAG microcontroller which can be built
      on top of this drivers. Driver exposes the set of IOCTL to the
      user space for:
      SIR (Scan Instruction Register, IEEE 1149.1 Data Register scan);
      SDR (Scan Data Register, IEEE 1149.1 Instruction Register scan);
      RUNTEST (Forces IEEE 1149.1 bus to a run state for specified
      number of clocks).

      If you want this support, you should say Y here.

      To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will
      be called jtag.

menuconfig JTAG_ASPEED
    tristate "Aspeed SoC JTAG controller support"
    depends on JTAG && HAS_IOMEM
    depends on ARCH_ASPEED || COMPILE_TEST
    ---help---
      This provides a support for Aspeed JTAG device, equipped on
      Aspeed SoC 24xx and 25xx families. Drivers allows programming
      of hardware devices, connected to SoC through the JTAG interface.

      If you want this support, you should say Y here.

      To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will
      be called jtag-aspeed.

config JTAG_ASPEED_LEGACY_UIO
    bool "ASPEED JTAG Legacy User Space I/O Support"
	  depends on JTAG_ASPEED
	  help
	    If you say yes here, you get a set of sysfs interfaces and ioctl
	    commands for supporting legacy user space applications.

config JTAG_ASPEED_USE_INTERRUPTS
    bool "Enable interrupt mode"
    default y
    depends on JTAG_ASPEED
    ---help---
      If y, use Interrupt Service Routine(ISR) to monitor IR/DR transmission signal.
      Otherwise, use iteration instead.
