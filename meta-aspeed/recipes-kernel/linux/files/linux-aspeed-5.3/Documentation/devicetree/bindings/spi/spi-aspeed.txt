* Aspeed SPI Master Controller

The 2 SPI master controllers in the AST2500 each supports 2 chip selects.

Required properties:
  - compatible : Should be
	"aspeed,ast2500-spi-master" for the AST2500 SPI Controllers

  - reg : the first contains the control register location and length,
          the second contains the memory window mapping address and length
  - #address-cells : must be 1 corresponding to chip select child binding
  - #size-cells : must be 0 corresponding to chip select child binding
  - clocks: Must contain the clock source

Example:
spi1: flash-controller@1e630000 {
	reg = < 0x1e630000 0xc4
		0x30000000 0x08000000 >;
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;
	compatible = "aspeed,ast2500-spi-master";
	clocks = <&syscon ASPEED_CLK_AHB>;
};
