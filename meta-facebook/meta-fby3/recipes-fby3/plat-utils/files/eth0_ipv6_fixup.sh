# Short-Description:  Workaround for IPv6 issue
### END INIT INFO

# This file contains definitions for the GPIO pins that were not otherwise
# defined in other files.  We should probably move some more of the
# definitions to this file at some point.

# The commented-out sections are generally already defined elsewhere,
# and defining them twice generates errors.

# The exception to this is the definition of the GPIO H0, H1, and H2
# pins, which seem to adversely affect the rebooting of the system.
# When defined, the system doesn't reboot cleanly.  We're still
# investigating this.

# When BMC performs the sled-cycle, IPv6 may be lost next time.
# The lost of IPv6 can be recovered when BMC re-initializes the network of BMC. 
# And so, add this script as a workaround to fix the issue.
# The script will be removed when the issue is solved.
