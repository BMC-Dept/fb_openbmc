FSCD config attribute help:

"pwm_transition_value":
  The PWM value of transistional mode.

"pwm_boost_value":
  The PWM value of boost mode.

"sample_interval_ms":
  The interval value(in millisecond) between monitoring cycles.

"boost":
  List the boost type.
  "fan_fail": true/false
    This label is for determining whether to count, log, and act for fan fail.
  "sensor_fail": true/false
    This label is for specifing fail_sensor_type is used or not.
    The detail of fail_sensor_type is shown below.
  "progressive": true/false
    This label is for specifing fan_dead_boost is used or not.
    The detail of fan_dead_boost is shown below.

"fan_dead_boost":
  [N1,M1],
  [N2,M2]
  If the number of dead fans is between N(#-1) and N#,
  the PWM will increase M%.
  If the number of dead fans is more than the latest N#, 
  the PWM will be pwm_boost_value.

"fail_sensor_type":
  "SSD_sensor_fail": true/false
    If SSD sensors are failed, FSCD will execute ssd_progressive_algorithm.
    The detail of ssd_progressive_algorithm is shown below.
    standby_sensor_fail must be true when using this label.
  "server_sensor_fail": true/false
    The server sensor is a sensor which works when the server power is on.
    If server sensors are failed, the PWM will be pwm_boost_value.
    standby_sensor_fail must be true when using this label.
  "standby_sensor_fail": true/false
    The standby sensor is a sensor which works when the standby power is on.
    If standby sensor is failed, the PWM will be pwm_boost_value.

"ssd_progressive_algorithm":
  "offset_algorithm":
    [N,M]
    If the number of failed SSD sensors is less than N,
    the PWM will increase M%.
    SSD_sensor_fail must be true when using this label.

"watchdog": true/false
  Kick watchdog by FSCD or not.

"chassis_intrusion": true/false
  If the chassis is intruded, the PWM will be pwm_boost_value.

"min_rpm":
  If a fan speed is less than min_rpm, it will be considered dead fan.
