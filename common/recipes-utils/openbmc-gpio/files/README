1. Two board GPIO tables under the directory of
./meta-openbmc/common/recipes-utils/openbmc-gpio/files.
board_gpio_table.py has fixed-base address and board_tolerance_gpio_table.py has
specific base address depends on the specific platform and can be generated via
the tolerance function. One extra GPIO table board_passthrough_gpio_table.py
used to avoid the passthrough happens in hardware reset. All of them can be
reloaded by the script under $PLATFORM/recipes-$PLATFORM/openbmc-gpio/files.
    1.1 These thress reloadable scripts board_gpio_table.py,
    board_tolerance_gpio_table.py and board_passthrough_gpio_table are parsed by
    the parsing script under the specific platform.
    1.2 Runnning the following command to generate them.
        E.g. # python lightning_gpio_parse.py lightning-BMC-GPIO-DVT.csv
2. To build the platform image, the openbmc-gpio_%.bbappend will install
setup_board.py and be appended to the openbmc-gpio_0.1.bb(under the common
directory).
3. To verify the correctness of the gpio configuration, running the script
"gpio_verification.sh" in bmc side. Compares the generated log file between the
released image and the modified image.
